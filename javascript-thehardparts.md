# üìö JavaScript Notes

## Based on "JavaScript: The Hard Parts v2" by Will Sentance (FrontendMasters)

## üåü Section 2: JavaScript Principles 
- JavaScript executes code line by line-known as the `thread of execution` (take the code, do it.)
- `Saves data` like strings, arrays, and functions `in memory` so we can use it later.
- `Identifiers` don‚Äôt store values, they point to memory locations where values exist!
- When JavaScript first sees a function, it doesn‚Äôt execute it right away. Instead, it stores the function in memory and only runs it when called.
- When you define a function, JavaScript stores it in memory.
- When you call a function using (), JavaScript executes the function immediately‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt store the call itself.
- Memory can only store values, can't store "go do something"

| **Term**                 | **Meaning**                                     | **Example**      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| **Declaration**         | Creating a variable without assigning a value  | `let x;`         |
| **Initialization**      | Assigning a value to a variable for the first time | `let y = 5;`     |
| **Uninitialized Variable** | A declared variable that has not yet been assigned a value | `let z; // Uninitialized (value is undefined)` |
 
### What is hoisting?
- Hoisting in JavaScript means that variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, before the code executes.
- However, only function declarations and variable declarations (without initialization) are hoisted‚Äînot assignments.
```js
// Variables declared with var are hoisted but initialized as undefined.
console.log(x); // ‚ùå Undefined, but NO ERROR (declaration hoisted)
var x = 10;
console.log(x); //10

//Variables declared with let and const are hoisted, but not initialized (TDZ ERROR).
console.log(y); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 20;
console.log(y); //20
```

| **Term**                  | **Definition**                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Function Declaration**   | Stored in memory during the initial phase (hoisted).         |
| **Function Expression**    | Stored only when the code reaches it (not hoisted).          |
| **Hoisting**              | Declarations are hoisted, but expressions are not.           |

```js
// Function Declaration (Stored & Hoisted)
// Function declarations are hoisted, stored in memory first and can be used before their definition. 
greet(); // ‚úÖ Works! Because it's hoisted

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// Function Expression (Not Hoisted)
// Function expressions are only stored when the code runs.
sayHello(); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sayHello' before initialization

const sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```
- `Execution Context` = `Thread of Execution` + `Memory`
- Every function is like a mini app so calling a function creates a new `Execution Context`
- Once the function finishes running, its Execution Context is removed from memory.
- Each time a function is called, JavaScript creates a separate memory space for that function. This space is called `local memory`

### Call Stack

```txt
 +-----------------+
 |  Call Stack     |  ‚Üê Last In, First Out (LIFO)
 |-----------------|
 | funcC()        |  ‚Üê Most recent function call
 | funcB()        |  
 | funcA()        |  
 | main()         |  
 +-----------------+
         ‚Üì (when function completes, it's removed)
 +-----------------+
 |  Global Context |  ‚Üê Always at the bottom, remains until program ends
 +-----------------+
```
- The Call Stack is a data structure that JavaScript uses to keep track of function calls. 
- Call Stack follows the `LIFO (Last In, First Out)` principle.
- When a function is called, it is pushed onto the call stack.
- When a function is completed, it is popped from the call stack.
- If the Call Stack becomes too full with function calls and is not cleared, a `Stack Overflow` error occurs.

```js
function recursive() {
    recursive();
}

recursive();
//Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```
- Asynchronous operations (setTimeout, fetch) do not run directly in the Call Stack; they are managed by the Event Loop.

#### **JavaScript Asynchronous Process (4-Step Execution)**  
1. `Call Stack`  
   - JavaScript Engine (like V8) executes code inside the Call Stack.  
   - Functions are pushed onto the stack and removed when execution completes.  

2. `Web APIs`
   - Asynchronous operations (setTimeout, fetch, DOM events) do not stay in the Call Stack.  
   - The browser handles them separately in the Web APIs environment.  

3. `Callback Queue` 
   - Once an async operation is completed, its callback is placed in the Callback Queue.  

4. `Event Loop` 
   - The Event Loop continuously checks if the Call Stack is empty.  
   - If empty, it moves tasks from the Callback Queue back to the Call Stack for execution.  
   - This ensures JavaScript remains non-blocking and runs efficiently.  

```txt
 +-----------------+
 |   Call Stack    |
 |-----------------|
 |   sync tasks    |   ‚Üê Function execution happens here
 |                 |
 +-----------------+
         ‚Üì (if async)
 +-----------------+
 |   Web APIs      |   ‚Üê setTimeout, fetch, DOM events handled by browser
 +-----------------+
         ‚Üì (when async task completes)
 +-----------------+
 | Callback Queue  |   ‚Üê Callbacks wait here
 +-----------------+
         ‚Üì (if Call Stack is empty)
 +-----------------+
 |   Event Loop    |   ‚Üê Moves tasks from Callback Queue ‚Üí Call Stack
 +-----------------+

## üåü Section 3:  Functions & Callbacks 

### How Loops Work in JavaScript?
- JavaScript engines process loops inside the Execution Context, but `loops themselves do not get pushed to the Call Stack`.
- Loops run within a `single Execution Context`, and each iteration performs specific operations.
- If a `function is called inside a loop, that function gets pushed onto the Call Stack` and removed once executed.
- When the loop finishes, the Execution Context is cleared, and memory is freed.
- In `infinite loop, the Call Stack does not overflow but the CPU usage reaches 100%`, freezing the browser.

#### Loops with Asynchronous Code (setTimeout and Loops)
```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// what we expect: 0 1 2
// what happened: 3 3 3
```
**Why does this happen? Let‚Äôs analyze it.**
- Each iteration immediately schedules a setTimeout() function in the Web API, but does not execute it right away.
- Since setTimeout is asynchronous, `it does not block the loop`; the loop completes before any setTimeout callback runs.
- By the time the setTimeout callbacks actually execute, the loop has already finished, and i is now 3.
- After 1000ms, the scheduled setTimeout callbacks are moved from the Web API to the callback queue.
- Since `var` does not have block scope, `all three callbacks reference the same i variable`, which is now 3.

```js
//Fixing the Issue: Using let
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
//Now the output is: 0 1 2
```
**Why does let work?**
- `let has block scope`, so a `new i is created for each iteration`.
- `Each iteration of the loop has its own separate i`, so when setTimeout executes, it references the correct value.

#### In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. This means:
- **Functions behave like objects**
- You can assign functions to variables.
- You can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
- You can return functions from other functions.
- Functions can have properties and methods just like objects.

- `Higher Order Function` (HOF) is a function that either `takes another function as an argument` (known as a callback function) or `returns a function` as its result.
- `Callback Function` is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later.
- Callbacks and Higher Order Functions simplify our code and keep it DRY

#### **Pair Programming** 
Pair Programming is a software development technique where **two programmers work together on the same code** at the same time.  

- `Driver`: Actively writes the code.  
- `Navigator`: Reviews each line, gives feedback, and guides the approach.  
- They `switch roles frequently` to ensure collaboration and shared understanding.  

This method helps improve **code quality, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving efficiency**.

## üåü Section 4: Closure
- Local Memory = Variable Environment (VE) = State
- When the function finishes executing, its local memory is deleted (except the returned value)

#### üß† What if a function could remember the past, even after it finished running? What if it could hold on to data instead of starting from scratch every time?
- It all starts with us returning a function from another function.
- A closure allows a function to remember and access variables from its outer (lexical) scope, even after that outer function has finished execution.

```js
function outer() {
        let unusedVar = 0; // Memory Leak. This value and label in memory but you can't access them.
        let count = 0; // This stays in memory

        function incrementCounter() {
                count++;
                console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        }

    return incrementCounter; // Returning the function with its backpack
}

const myNewFunction = outer(); // outer runs, returns incrementCounter (with its memory!)

myNewFunction(); // Count: 1
myNewFunction(); // Count: 2
myNewFunction(); // Count: 3

```

</div>

- When a function is returned from another function, it carries its surrounding memory (scope) with it.
- This means the returned function remembers variables from its parent function, even after the parent function has finished execution.
- The function‚Äôs local memory is preserved and remains accessible whenever the function is called later.
- When executed, the function first looks into its own local memory for variables.
- If the variable isn‚Äôt found, it looks into its closure scope (or "backpack"), which contains references to the parent function‚Äôs memory.
- You can't directly access this "permanent memory" (closure scope) from the outside.
 
**When an inner function is returned from its parent function, it keeps a reference to the outer function‚Äôs variables via a hidden property called [[scope]]. This allows the inner function to access and modify the outer function‚Äôs variables even after the outer function has been removed from the call stack.**

- Closed over ‚ÄòVariable Environment‚Äô (C.O.V.E.) = Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data (P.L.S.R.D.) = `Closure` (most commonly used)

**you might find this helpful:** https://medium.com/dailyjs/i-never-understood-javascript-closures-9663703368e8

```js
// Individual backpacks
function outer() {
    let count = 0; // Each call to outer() creates a new count variable

    function incrementCounter() {
        count++;
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    }

    return incrementCounter;
}

const counter1 = outer(); // New closure with its own count variable
const counter2 = outer(); // Another closure with a separate count variable

counter1(); // Count: 1 (counter1)
counter1(); // Count: 2 (counter1)

counter2(); // Count: 1 (counter2, separate closure, they have different backpack)
counter2(); // Count: 2 (counter2)
```
```js
function outer() {
    let count = 0; // Stored inside the closure

    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(`Incremented: ${count}`);
        },
        decrement: function () {
            count--;
            console.log(`Decremented: ${count}`);
        },
        reset: function () {
            count = 0;
            console.log(`Reset: ${count}`);
        }
    };
}

const counter = outer(); // Creates a closure

counter.increment(); // Incremented: 1
counter.increment(); // Incremented: 2
counter.decrement(); // Decremented: 1
counter.reset();     // Reset: 0
counter.increment(); // Incremented: 1
```
```js
let count = 0; // Global scope

function outer() {
    function incrementCounter() {
        count++;
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    }

    return incrementCounter;
}

const myNewFunction = outer();
myNewFunction(); // Count: 1
myNewFunction(); // Count: 2

const anotherFunction = outer();
anotherFunction(); // Count: 3 (Since count is global, it affects all instances)
anotherFunction(); // Count: 4
```
#### **Why Use Closures?**  
Closures provide functions with persistent memory, unlocking powerful patterns for writing clean, maintainable, and professional JavaScript code. 

- **Persistent State** ‚Äì Functions can "remember" data even after execution.  
- **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Helps protect variables from being accessed or modified outside their intended scope.  
- **Memory Efficiency** ‚Äì Avoids unnecessary global variables.  
- **Practical Uses:**  
  - ‚úÖ **Helper Functions** ‚Äì Utilities like `once` and `memoize` leverage closures.  
  - ‚úÖ **Iterators & Generators** ‚Äì Use lexical scoping and closures to manage data flow.  
  - ‚úÖ **Module Pattern** ‚Äì Keep state without polluting the global scope.  
  - ‚úÖ **Asynchronous JS** ‚Äì Callbacks, Promises, and async/await rely on closures to persist state.
